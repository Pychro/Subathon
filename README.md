# Subathon Controller
The Subathon Controller is a tool created for Twitch streamers to interact with their viewers in a fun, productive way.

This allows the streamer to create a timer overlay that will automatically update when there is a new subcription.

## How to Use
When you first start the program you will be greeted with a screen that goes over the basics of the project. This will direct you to press the Home button which will take you to the main screen where you can edit your main variables for the Subathon. After you have finished setting these up head to the Time Per Sub page where you can set how much the timer will increase per subscription. Finally you are ready to return to the Home screen and start your Subathon.

After you have completed your Subathon you can check out your statistics for the Subahton and all past Subathons to see where this one ranks.

## Project Goals
Eventually adding the ability to use a "Roulette" mode in which when a subcription is detected a wheel of prize show up on screen and is spun to decide the time added to the timer. The Streamer will be able to manually input the different prizes on the wheel with the ability to change the chance of it landing. This will in turn change the size of the piece of the circle on the roulette wheel.
